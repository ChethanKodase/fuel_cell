# Modeling and Simulation of PEM Hydrogen fuel cell

The model involves the system of Proton Exchange Membrane Hydrogen Fuel cell system involving anode and cathode electrodes, a proton exchange memberane,
inlet and out let manifolds for the entry and exit of air and hydrogen to thhe fuel cell. The circuit also includes reciprocating compressors and compressed gas storage systems. 

Polarization curve of Voltage vs Current is obtained as output. Along with this, dynamic system response various other time dependent parameters like mass flow rate, pressure, density and 
temeratures could also be obtained
